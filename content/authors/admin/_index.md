My name is Emilio Ottonello. In 2021 I gratuated cum laude in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Genoa. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Advanced and Humanoid Robotics at the Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia.
My research topic is the application of the Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies in robotics. I mostly work on additively manufactured compliant mechanisms and high mechanical properties curved printed parts.
